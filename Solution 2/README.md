This project provides a solution to secure .NET core API using JWT authentication

Solution 2:
In this solution, We have 2 Projects. 
   1. Demo API 
   2. Authentication API   

Token is generated by the Authentication API and validated by the Demo API.

  1. Client calls Demo API Login Method. Demo API redirects the request to Authentication API
  2. Authentication API validates the credentials. On Successful Login, It generates token and sends it to Demo API.
  3. Demo API returns the token to the Client. 
  4. Client attaches the bearer token while sending subsequent requests to Demo API.
  5. Token is validated by the Demo API. On succesful token validation, the request is processed by the Demo API.

In this scenario, the Client only interacts with Demo API. Authentication API is hidden from client.
