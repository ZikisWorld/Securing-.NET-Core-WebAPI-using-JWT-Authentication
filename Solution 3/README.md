This project provides a solution to secure .NET core API using JWT authentication

Solution 3:
In this solution, we have 2 Projects.
   1. Demo API 
   2. Authentication API   

Token is generated by the Authentication API and validated by the Demo API.

  1. Client calls Authentication API Login Method. 
  2. Authentication API validates the credentials. On Successful Login, It generates token and sends it as reponse to the client.
  3. Client attaches the bearer token while sending subsequent requests to Demo API.
  4. Token is validated by the Demo API. On succesful token validation, the request is processed by the Demo API.

In this scenario, the Client interacts with both Authentication API and Demo API.
